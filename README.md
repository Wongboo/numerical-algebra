## Happy_matrix_1
### main issue  
In the auxiliary function, you have to manually rather than automatically type the name of function, wish someone can solve it in the issue. The possible solution is the macro **\_\_PRETTY_FUNCTION\_\_** / **\_\_func\_\_** or the previous experimental class **std::source_location**, but I haven't figured out.  
### optional  
You can uncomment the note in the [auxiliary.hpp](happy_matrix_1/include/auxiliary.hpp), and optionally subsitute **std::initializer_list** with other container or pointer, so that you can write a single line of function **happy_matrix::auxiliay** instead of several.
